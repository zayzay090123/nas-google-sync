# NAS-Google-Sync

**Free up Google storage by backing up your photos to a Synology NAS.**

Google killed their Photos API in March 2025. This tool works around that by importing your photos from Google Takeout and uploading them to Synology Photos.

## What It Does

1. **Scans** your Synology NAS to see what photos you already have
2. **Imports** your Google Takeout export and detects duplicates
3. **Uploads** only NEW photos to your Synology (skips duplicates)
4. **Tells you** which photos are safe to delete from Google (with date ranges)
5. **Preserves dates** by reading the JSON metadata files from Google Takeout

## Quick Start (Single User)

### 1. Install Node.js

Download and install from **https://nodejs.org** (click the LTS version).

To verify it worked, open a terminal and type:
```
node --version
```

### 2. Download This Tool

**Option A:** Click the green "Code" button above → "Download ZIP" → Extract it

**Option B:** Or use git:
```
git clone https://github.com/pfilbin90/nas-google-sync.git
```

### 3. Install & Build

Open a terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Configure

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Open `.env` in a text editor and fill in your Synology details:

```env
SYNOLOGY_HOST=192.168.1.100       # Your NAS IP address
SYNOLOGY_PORT=5000
SYNOLOGY_ACCOUNTS=myaccount

SYNOLOGY_myaccount_USERNAME=your_synology_username
SYNOLOGY_myaccount_PASSWORD=your_synology_password
SYNOLOGY_myaccount_PHOTO_PATH=/homes/your_synology_username/Photos

GOOGLE_ACCOUNTS=mygoogle
PAIRING_1_GOOGLE=mygoogle
PAIRING_1_SYNOLOGY=myaccount
```

> **Note:** Your Synology user must be in the **Administrators group** (DSM 7 requirement).

### 5. Export Your Photos from Google

1. Go to [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Click "Deselect all"
3. Scroll down and check **Google Photos**
4. Click "Next step" → Create export
5. Wait for Google's email, then download and extract the ZIP file(s)

> **Tip:** If you get multiple ZIP files, extract them all into the same folder.

### 6. Run It

```bash
# First, scan your Synology to find existing photos
node dist/index.js scan

# Import the Google Takeout
node dist/index.js import "C:\path\to\Takeout\Google Photos" --account mygoogle

# Upload to Synology
node dist/index.js sync --account mygoogle

# See what's safe to delete from Google
node dist/index.js export --format dates --account mygoogle
```

> **Note:** If your path has spaces, make sure the entire command is on one line.

## Multiple Users (You + Spouse)

Each person needs their own Google Takeout export and their own Synology account.

### Configure for Two Users

```env
SYNOLOGY_HOST=192.168.1.100
SYNOLOGY_PORT=5000
SYNOLOGY_ACCOUNTS=user1,user2

# User 1 (you)
SYNOLOGY_user1_USERNAME=your_username
SYNOLOGY_user1_PASSWORD=your_password
SYNOLOGY_user1_PHOTO_PATH=/homes/your_username/Photos

# User 2 (spouse)
SYNOLOGY_user2_USERNAME=spouse_username
SYNOLOGY_user2_PASSWORD=spouse_password
SYNOLOGY_user2_PHOTO_PATH=/homes/spouse_username/Photos

GOOGLE_ACCOUNTS=me,spouse
PAIRING_1_GOOGLE=me
PAIRING_1_SYNOLOGY=user1
PAIRING_2_GOOGLE=spouse
PAIRING_2_SYNOLOGY=user2
```

### Run for Each Person

**Step 1:** Each person exports from [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com) and extracts to separate folders.

**Step 2:** Import and sync each account separately:

```bash
# Scan Synology first (only needed once)
node dist/index.js scan

# YOUR photos
node dist/index.js import "C:\Takeout\me" --account me
node dist/index.js sync --account me

# SPOUSE's photos
node dist/index.js import "C:\Takeout\spouse" --account spouse
node dist/index.js sync --account spouse
```

**Step 3:** See what each person can delete from Google:

```bash
# Your backed-up photos
node dist/index.js export --format dates --account me

# Spouse's backed-up photos
node dist/index.js export --format dates --account spouse
```

Each person then deletes from their **own** Google Photos account based on their date ranges.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `node dist/index.js scan` | Index photos already on your Synology |
| `node dist/index.js import <path> --account <name>` | Import a Google Takeout folder |
| `node dist/index.js sync --account <name>` | Upload new photos to Synology |
| `node dist/index.js export --format dates --account <name>` | Show backed-up photos for that account |
| `node dist/index.js inspect` | Verify duplicate detection is working |
| `node dist/index.js workflow` | Show detailed step-by-step guide |

### Inspect Command Options

Use `inspect` to debug and verify that duplicate matching is working:

```bash
# Search for a specific photo in both Synology and Takeout
node dist/index.js inspect --search "IMG_1234.jpg"

# Show photos that exist in BOTH sources (matched duplicates)
node dist/index.js inspect --matched

# Show sample Synology photos with their dates
node dist/index.js inspect --synology

# Show photos marked as "new" (not found on Synology)
node dist/index.js inspect --new

# Control how many results to show (default: 20)
node dist/index.js inspect --synology -n 50
```

## Deleting Photos from Google

Google doesn't let apps delete photos. After confirming your backup, use [Google Photos Toolkit](https://github.com/xob0t/Google-Photos-Toolkit) (a free browser extension) to bulk-delete by date range.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Authentication failed | Add your Synology user to the Administrators group in DSM |
| 0 new photos found | All photos already exist on Synology - that's good! |
| Multiple ZIP files | Extract all ZIPs into the same folder before importing |
| "Already on Synology" count is 0 | Make sure you ran `scan` before `import` |
| Wrong dates on photos | Check if the `.supplemental-metadata.json` files exist in your Takeout |

---

## How Duplicate Detection Works

The tool matches photos between Google Takeout and Synology using:
1. **Filename + Date** - Same filename taken on the same day
2. **File hash** - Identical file content (when available)

Photos that match are marked as "Already on Synology" and won't be uploaded again. They're also included in the export so you know they're safe to delete from Google.
